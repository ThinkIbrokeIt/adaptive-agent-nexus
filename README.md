# Adaptive Agent Nexus v0.7.0-alpha

## Introduction

The Adaptive Agent Nexus is an intelligent system designed to bring context-aware, self-learning capabilities to AI agents. By implementing the innovative Monitor-Contextualize-Personalize (McP) workflow architecture, this platform enables agents to:

- **Learn from interactions** through continuous feedback loops
- **Adapt responses** based on contextual understanding
- **Improve over time** by self-optimizing knowledge representation
- **Provide personalized experiences** tailored to specific user needs

The system solves critical challenges in traditional AI implementations, including context amnesia, static knowledge representation, and one-size-fits-all responses. Through its adaptable architecture, the platform bridges the gap between raw data collection and meaningful, personalized agent interactions.

### `feedback [on|off]`

- **Description**: Controls the agent's self-learning feedback loop
- **Usage**: Type `feedback on` or `feedback off`
- **Example**:

  ```
  > feedback on
  Feedback loop enabled. Agent will continuously learn from interactions.

  > feedback off
  Feedback loop disabled. Agent will not adapt from interactions.

  > feedback
  Current feedback status: ENABLED
  ```

## Voice Interface

### `voice [on|off]`

- **Description**: Controls the agent's voice response capability
- **Usage**: Type `voice on` or `voice off`
- **Example**:
